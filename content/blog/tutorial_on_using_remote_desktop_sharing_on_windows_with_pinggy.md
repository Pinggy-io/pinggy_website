1. **Step 1.** Run this command to obtain a public address for your Windows PC.
   ```
   ssh -p 443 -R0:127.0.0.1:3389 tcp@a.pinggy.io
   ```
After running this command, it outputs a public address that you can use to access your Windows PC's RDP service. For example: `tcp://kduyqzdhwu.a.pinggy.link:3389`

2. **Step 2.** Connect using the Remote Desktop Connection application by opening it and entering the address and port given by the Pinggy command in Step 1.

## Remote Desktop in Windows

**Remote Desktop Protocol** (RDP) is a built-in Windows feature that allows you to remotely access and control your computer as if you were sitting in front of it. RDP is widely used in IT management, remote work, and personal use for accessing files, applications, or managing tasks. However, establishing a secure RDP connection over the internet can be challenging due to network configurations and security concerns.

## Problems with NAT, CGNAT, and Firewalls

Network Address Translation (NAT) and Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT) assign private IP addresses to devices, restricting direct access from external networks. Similarly, firewalls block unauthorized traffic to protect devices. These barriers make it difficult to establish an RDP connection unless you configure port forwarding or obtain a public IP address.

[Pinggy](https://pinggy.io) offers a streamlined solution, bypassing these restrictions with its tunneling service, allowing secure and straightforward remote access without modifying your router or exposing your system to vulnerabilities.

## Step-by-Step Guide

Pinggy enables a secure RDP connection to your machine, even behind a firewall or NAT router. Follow these steps:
### Step 1: Setup remote desktop connection using Pinggy.
1. Open your terminal or command prompt on the Windows machine you want to access. Use the following command to set up a tunnel:

   ```bash
   ssh -p 443 -R0:127.0.0.1:3389 tcp@a.pinggy.io
   ```

   

   {{< pinggytunnel box="true" mode="tcp" tunnelstring="Paste this command to start a tunnel to SSH server:" portstring="SSH server Port" localport="3389" webdebugenabled=false keepalive=true tryYourselfText="Customize your command:" >}}{{< /pinggytunnel >}}

2. Once executed, it will ask for permission to connect. Grant the permission, and if prompted for a password, enter it or press Enter. Pinggy will then provide a public URL and port, such as: `tcp://kduyqzdhwu.a.pinggy.link:22348`

This command creates a tunnel that forwards traffic from Pinggy’s server to your local machine’s RDP port (3389).
### Step 2: Access Your Machine Using Remote Desktop Connection
Open the Remote Desktop Connection app on another computer. Enter the public URL provided by Pinggy. For example, in our case, it was:

   ```bash
   kduyqzdhwu.a.pinggy.link:22348
   ```

Click on Connect and provide the credentials for your Windows account.

You are now securely connected to your Windows desktop!
