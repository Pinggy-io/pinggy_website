When it comes to online gaming, a stable and fast internet connection is crucial for an optimal experience. While many gamers focus on their ISP or router settings, an often-overlooked factor is the DNS ({{< link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System" >}}Domain Name System{{< /link >}} ). Choosing the best DNS for gaming can significantly reduce latency, improve connection reliability, and even prevent issues like DNS server errors.

Thus, in this article, we will learn why DNS matter for gaming, the recommended DNS servers for gaming and how to set them up in a proper way.

### What is DNS, and Why Does It Matter for Gaming?

Domain Name System (DNS), also known as the 'phone book' of the Internet, is where web detials are stored for its site points. Without it, your device wouldn’t be able to connect to websites or online services. In place of needing to remember complex IP addresses such as `192.168.1.1`, DNS converts easy to remember domain names (e.g. `www.example.com`) into numerical IP addresses so computers can talk to one another. 

Whenever you type a URL into your browser, or connect to a server for gaming, your device makes a request to a DNS server to look up the host’s domain name and give it back a corresponding IP address. It happens behind the scenes and usually takes only milliseconds. But the little delays can mean big things to gamers.

In the context of gaming, a poor or unreliable DNS server can introduce issues such as:

1. **Increased Latency**: The time it takes for your device to query a DNS server and retrieve the IP address can affect your ping or latency. High latency leads to lag, making real-time actions in games less responsive.
   
2. **Connection Failures**: Some DNS servers may experience downtime or errors, causing delays or failures when trying to connect to gaming servers.

3. **Poor Server Routing**: A suboptimal DNS can direct your traffic through slower routes, increasing response times between your device and the gaming server.

4. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Without proper protections, DNS servers can be vulnerable to attacks like DNS spoofing, potentially exposing your data to threats.

On the other hand, using a fast, reliable, and gaming-optimized DNS can:

- Lower latency (decrease query response times).
- This helps ensure that the connection is stable, that server addresses always resolve consistently.
- Conceal protection from malicious attacks.

In the end, gaming DNS means better performance, lag-free experience, giving you the competitive edge in real-time multiplayer games.


### How to Choose the Best DNS for Gaming

Selecting the best DNS server for gaming involves evaluating several critical factors. Here’s a detailed guide on what to consider:

#### 1. Low Latency
The amount of time taken by a data packet from your device till it reaches a server and back is latency. Low latency (or ping, a funny play on words) is indispensable in gaming, but it keeps people sane — or at least focused. Because milliseconds are of importance in competitive gaming, a faster hitting DNS server can shave off milliseconds which can make a difference.

- **Why It Matters**: Faster DNS responses mean quicker connections to gaming servers, reducing lag.
- **Tip**: Use tools like **Namebench** or **DNS Jumper** to measure latency for different DNS servers.

##### Steps to Test Latency Using `ping`:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Type and press Enter.
   ````plaintext
   ping 8.8.8.8
   ````
3. Observe the output for the time taken (`time=XX ms`) to measure the round-trip latency.

##### **Example Output:**
{{< image "best_dns_for_gaming/ping_result.webp" "Ping 8.8.8.8" >}}

The `time=XX ms` values indicate the latency. Lower values mean better latency.

###### Comparing Multiple DNS Servers

Repeat the `ping` test with other DNS servers like Cloudflare's `1.1.1.1`:

```plaintext
ping 1.1.1.1
```

###### Tools to Automate Latency Testing

For a more comprehensive comparison:
- {{< link href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/namebench/" >}}Namebench{{< /link >}}: Tests multiple DNS servers for latency and recommends the fastest.
- {{< link href="https://www.sordum.org/7952/dns-jumper-v2-2/" >}}DNS Jumper{{< /link >}}: Allows you to test and switch DNS servers easily.

#### 2. Reliability
High availability and stability of the DNS server is required. The unconsequential tidings of intermittent connectivity issues that can ruin your gaming sessions are caused by unreliable DNS servers.

- **Why It Matters**: A reliable DNS ensures consistent access to gaming servers without interruptions.
- **What to Look For**: Check for uptime guarantees and global server infrastructure from your chosen DNS provider.

#### 3. Security
To address **"How do they use DNSSEC?"**, we can expand the **Security** section as follows:

---

#### 3. Security
Security is often overlooked in the world of online gaming, but it is crucial. DNS providers offer many security features, such as blocking malicious domains, phishing protection, and encrypted DNS queries. 

One of the key technologies ensuring secure DNS resolution is **DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions)**. DNSSEC protects gamers by ensuring the authenticity and integrity of DNS data. It prevents attackers from redirecting you to malicious websites through DNS spoofing or man-in-the-middle attacks. DNSSEC uses cryptographic signatures to verify that the DNS responses you receive are legitimate and haven't been tampered with. 

- **How It Works**: 
  - DNSSEC digitally signs DNS records using public-key cryptography.
  - When your device queries a domain, the DNS resolver checks the cryptographic signatures to confirm the data's authenticity.
  - If the signature doesn’t match, the response is rejected, preventing spoofed or harmful DNS responses from affecting your gameplay.

- **Why It Matters**: Prevents DNS spoofing, man-in-the-middle attacks, and other threats that could compromise your connection or gaming accounts.

- **Top Picks**: DNS providers like **Quad9** and **Cloudflare DNS** prioritize security by supporting DNSSEC and providing additional features like malware and phishing protection, ensuring a safe gaming experience without sacrificing speed.

#### 4. Customization Options
When it comes to a DNS service for advanced gamers, they often seek out DNS services that offer content filtering or parental controls or custom routing options.

- **Why It Matters**: Customization lets you block unnecessary distractions or optimize routing for specific games.
- **Examples**: OpenDNS allows for filtering and advanced controls, making it a great option for families or shared networks.

#### 5. Global Server Coverage
The location of DNS servers can impact their speed and reliability. Opt for a DNS provider with a wide distribution of servers to ensure optimal performance, regardless of your location.

Global coverage is often achieved through a technique called {{< link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anycast" >}}anycasting{{< /link >}}, where multiple servers share the same IP address, routing users to the nearest or best-performing server automatically. This minimizes latency and improves reliability.

- **Why It Matters**: Global server coverage reduces the chance of routing delays, especially when gaming on international servers.
- **Supported Providers**: Cloudflare DNS, Google Public DNS, and Quad9 all utilize anycasting for efficient and fast DNS resolution.
- **Tip**: Cloudflare DNS is known for its vast global presence, making it an excellent choice for gamers worldwide.
