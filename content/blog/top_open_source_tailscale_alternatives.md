## Overview of Tailscale

Before exploring the alternatives, let's understand what makes Tailscale popular and why you might want an open source alternative.

Tailscale creates a secure mesh network using WireGuard as the underlying protocol. It handles complex networking tasks like NAT traversal, key distribution, and device discovery automatically. The service includes features like Magic DNS, subnet routing, and exit nodes, making it easy to connect devices across different networks securely.

#### Pros of Tailscale

Tailscale offers zero-configuration setup with automatic device discovery, making it incredibly easy to get started. Built on the secure and fast WireGuard protocol, it provides excellent NAT traversal capabilities and cross-platform support across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android. The Magic DNS feature makes device naming intuitive, while access control lists (ACLs) provide fine-grained permissions and exit nodes enable internet routing.

#### Cons of Tailscale

The main concerns with Tailscale include its proprietary control plane which creates potential vendor lock-in, limited customization options, and pricing that can become expensive for larger teams. There's also dependency on Tailscale's infrastructure and privacy concerns with the centralized coordination server.
