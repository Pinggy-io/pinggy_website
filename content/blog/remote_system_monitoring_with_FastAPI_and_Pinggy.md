Monitoring system metrics is essential for developers to ensure their applications run smoothly, optimize resource usage and quickly detect performance issues or bottlenecks. 
In this article, we’ll look at how to remotely monitor your system’s performance metrics—specifically CPU, RAM, memory and disk usage—using FastAPI and Pinggy. 
To accomplish this, we’ll use the {{< link href="https://pypi.org/project/psutil/" >}}psutil{{< /link >}} library, which provides easy access to real-time system resource data.
To expose this data, we first need to start a server and FastAPI is an ideal choice for this purpose. 
{{< link href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/" >}}FastAPI{{< /link >}} is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python, known for its speed and ease of setup. 
Once the FastAPI server is set up, it will run locally on your machine. 
However, since many systems are behind NAT (Network Address Translation) or CGNAT (Carrier-Grade NAT), remote access can be challenging. 
To overcome this, we’ll use Pinggy to easily share the server to the internet.
[Pinggy](https://pinggy.io) lets you expose your local FastAPI server to the internet with just a single command, even if your machine is behind a firewall, making it accessible remotely with minimal setup.

Now that we’ve covered the basics of this article, let’s move on to setting up a virtual environment and installing the necessary dependencies, including `FastAPI` and `psutil`, to start monitoring system performance metrics. 
These steps will ensure that our development environment is ready for the project.


## Setting Up the Environment and Installing Dependencies

### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment

When working on Python projects, it's recommended to use a virtual environment to keep the packages for each project separate and isolated.

To create a virtual environment, you can use the `venv` module that comes with Python.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

> Note: If the command `python` does not work, try replacing it with `python3`

That command creates a new virtual environment in a directory called `.venv`.

### Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment

Now, activate the new virtual environment to ensure that any Python commands you execute or packages you install are applied within it.

To activate the virtual environment use the following commands:

#### For Linux, MacOS

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### For Windows Powershell

```ps
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

#### For Windows Bash

```bash
source .venv/Scripts/activate
```

Once activated, it’s a good idea to upgrade `pip` before installing packages like FastAPI, especially if you’re working in a fresh environment or haven’t updated `pip` in a while.

To upgrade `pip`, simply run:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Step 3: Install FastAPI

Now that you've created and activated your virtual environment, it’s time to install `FastAPI` so we can start building the system monitoring application.

To install FastAPI, along with some optional dependencies that will be helpful, use the following command:

```bash
pip install "fastapi[standard]"
```

This will install FastAPI along with additional dependencies such as `uvicorn`, which is needed to run the FastAPI server.

### Step 4: Install psutil
<!-- {{< link href="https://pypi.org/project/psutil/" >}}psutil{{< /link >}} is a Python library used to retrieve information on system utilization, including CPU, memory, disk, and network usage. It is required for this FastAPI application to gather real-time performance metrics of the system, enabling efficient monitoring and reporting of key resources necessary for performance analysis.

To install `psutil` run the below command: -->
After installing FastAPI, the next step is to install {{< link href="https://pypi.org/project/psutil/" >}}psutil{{< /link >}}. 
This Python library provides access to system utilization data, including CPU, memory, disk, and network usage, which is crucial for monitoring your system's performance.

To install `psutil`, run the following command:

```bash
pip install psutil
```

With the dependencies installed, it’s time to build the FastAPI application that will allow us to monitor system performance metrics.

## Build the App to Monitor Your System Metrics

In this section, we will create routes for monitoring various system performance metrics, such as CPU usage, memory, and disk space. Each route will be explained separately to demonstrate how we can collect and display real-time system data using FastAPI.

> **Visit this GitHub Repository to access the codebase.** ({{< link href="https://github.com/AbhilashK26/Remote_system_monitoring_with_FastAPI_and_Pinggy" >}}GitHub Link{{< /link >}} )

Now, let's discuss each component of the system individually.

### Monitor CPU Usage Metrics

In this section, we will configure routes within our FastAPI application to monitor CPU usage on the system.

We'll expose three routes to monitor various aspects of the CPU:

1. `/cpu`: Get the overall CPU usage percentage.
2. `/cpu/cores`: Get the CPU usage for each core individually.
3. `/cpu/frequency`: Retrieve information about the current, minimum, and maximum CPU frequencies.

Here’s the **code** to monitor CPU usage:

```javascript
from fastapi import FastAPI
import psutil  # Assuming you are using psutil for CPU monitoring

app = FastAPI()

# Route to get CPU usage information
@app.get("/cpu")
async def get_cpu_usage():
    cpu_usage = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1)  # Returns CPU usage as a percentage
    return {"cpu_usage": cpu_usage}

# Route to get CPU core information
@app.get("/cpu/cores")
async def get_cpu_cores():
    core_usage = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1, percpu=True)  # Returns usage per core
    return {"core_usage": core_usage}

# Route to get CPU frequency information
@app.get("/cpu/frequency")
async def get_cpu_frequency():
    frequency = psutil.cpu_freq()  # Returns CPU frequency info
    return {
        "current": frequency.current,
        "min": frequency.min,
        "max": frequency.max
    }

```

The **outputs** of the different endpoints will be displayed as follows:

- `/cpu`:

```json
{ "cpu_usage": 45.3 }
```

{{< image "system_monitoring_fastapi/cpu_usage1.webp" "FastAPI application to monitor CPU metrices" >}}

- `/cpu/cores`:

```json
{ "core_usage": [50.2, 45.1, 40.5, 60.7] }
```

{{< image "system_monitoring_fastapi/cpu_usage2.webp" "FastAPI application to monitor CPU metrices" >}}

- `/cpu/frequency`:

```json
{ "current": 2200.0, "min": 1000.0, "max": 3500.0 }
```

{{< image "system_monitoring_fastapi/cpu_usage3.webp" "FastAPI application to monitor CPU metrices" >}}


### Track Memory and Swap Usage

In this section, we will create routes to monitor memory usage, which is important for understanding how much memory is being used and how much is available. 
We'll track both virtual memory and swap memory. 

>**Virtual memory** represents the system's total memory, while **swap memory** refers to disk-based memory used when physical memory is full. 

We’ll expose two routes:

1. `/memory`: Get the current status of virtual memory.
2. `/memory/swap`: Retrieve swap memory usage statistics.

Here’s the **code** to monitor memory and swap usage metrics:

```javascript
from fastapi import FastAPI
import psutil

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/memory")
async def get_memory_usage():
    """Returns virtual memory usage metrics."""
    memory = psutil.virtual_memory()
    return {
        "total": memory.total,
        "available": memory.available,
        "used": memory.used,
        "percent": memory.percent
    }

@app.get("/memory/swap")
async def get_swap_memory_usage():
    """Returns swap memory usage metrics."""
    swap = psutil.swap_memory()
    return {
        "total": swap.total,
        "used": swap.used,
        "free": swap.free,
        "percent": swap.percent,
        "sin": swap.sin,
        "sout": swap.sout
    }
```

After executing the code, the **responses** from each endpoint will look like this:

- `/memory`:

```json
{
  "total": 16777216000,
  "available": 8225292288,
  "used": 7374233600,
  "percent": 57.3
}
```

{{< image "system_monitoring_fastapi/memory1.webp" "FastAPI application to monitor Memory metrices" >}}

- `/memory/swap`:

```json
{
  "total": 8589934592,
  "used": 1073741824,
  "free": 7516192768,
  "percent": 12.5,
  "sin": 0,
  "sout": 0
}
```

{{< image "system_monitoring_fastapi/memory2.webp" "FastAPI application to monitor Memory metrices" >}}


### Monitor RAM Utilization

In this section, we'll focus on monitoring RAM usage as a percentage, which helps in understanding the system's memory health and efficiency. 

To achieve this, we’ll create a route that provides the RAM usage:

1. `/ram`: Returns RAM usage in percentage.

Here’s the **code** to track RAM utilization:

```javascript
from fastapi import FastAPI
import psutil

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/ram")
async def get_ram_usage():
    """Returns RAM usage in percentage."""
    return {"ram_usage": psutil.virtual_memory().percent}

# To run this application, use the following command:
# uvicorn <filename_without_py_extension>:app --reload
```

After executing the above code, the **response** from the endpoint will look like this:

- `/ram`:

```json
{ "ram_usage": 45.2 }
```

{{< image "system_monitoring_fastapi/ram1.webp" "FastAPI application to monitor RAM metrices" >}}


### Disk Usage and I/O Statistics

Monitoring disk usage is essential for understanding how much storage space is being utilized on the system. 
This includes tracking overall disk usage, checking mounted partitions, and displaying disk I/O statistics (read/write operations). 

To accomplish this, we’ll expose three routes:

1. `/disk`: Returns overall disk usage for the root filesystem.
2. `/disk/partitions`: Provides information about mounted disk partitions.
3. `/disk/io`: Displays disk I/O statistics.

Here’s the **code** to monitor disk usage and I/O statistics:

```javascript
from fastapi import FastAPI
import psutil

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/disk")
async def get_disk_usage():
    """Returns disk usage metrics for the root filesystem."""
    disk = psutil.disk_usage('/')
    return {
        "total": disk.total,
        "used": disk.used,
        "free": disk.free,
        "percent": disk.percent
    }

@app.get("/disk/partitions")
async def get_disk_partitions():
    """Returns information about mounted disk partitions."""
    partitions = psutil.disk_partitions()
    partition_info = []
    for partition in partitions:
        partition_info.append({
            "device": partition.device,
            "mountpoint": partition.mountpoint,
            "fstype": partition.fstype,
            "opts": partition.opts
        })
    return {"partitions": partition_info}

@app.get("/disk/io")
async def get_disk_io():
    """Returns disk I/O statistics."""
    io_stats = psutil.disk_io_counters()
    return {
        "read_count": io_stats.read_count,
        "write_count": io_stats.write_count,
        "read_bytes": io_stats.read_bytes,
        "write_bytes": io_stats.write_bytes,
        "read_time": io_stats.read_time,
        "write_time": io_stats.write_time
    }
```

The **responses** from each endpoint will look like this:

- `/disk`:

```json
{
  "total": 500107862016,
  "used": 237081992192,
  "free": 263025547776,
  "percent": 47.5
}
```

{{< image "system_monitoring_fastapi/disk1.webp" "FastAPI application to monitor Disk metrices" >}}

- `/disk/partitions`:

```json
{
  "partitions": [
    {
      "device": "/dev/sda1",
      "mountpoint": "/",
      "fstype": "ext4",
      "opts": "rw,relatime"
    }
  ]
}
```

{{< image "system_monitoring_fastapi/disk2.webp" "FastAPI application to monitor Disk metrices" >}}

- `/disk/io`:

```json
{
  "read_count": 1000000,
  "write_count": 500000,
  "read_bytes": 1048576000,
  "write_bytes": 524288000,
  "read_time": 5000,
  "write_time": 2000
}
```

## Run the FastAPI Application locally

Once you’ve set up the application and configured all the necessary routes, you can run the FastAPI application locally. 

To do so, simply use the following command:

```bash
fastapi dev main.py
```

This command will start the FastAPI server and make your endpoints available for testing and monitoring system metrics.

{{< image "host_fastapi_app/fastapi_dev_app.webp" "Run fastapi dev command" >}}

## Check the output

To view the results, open your browser and navigate to the following URL:

`http://127.0.0.1:8000/<required-endpoint>`

Each endpoint will return a JSON response with the requested system metrics. 
Simply replace `<required-endpoint>` with the specific route you want to test, such as `/cpu`, `/memory` or `/disk` and you’ll see the corresponding real-time system usage data.

## Remotely Access Your FastAPI App Using Pinggy
[Pinggy](https://pinggy.io) provides a simple and secure method to make your local FastAPI application accessible on the internet, even if your system is behind NAT or CGNAT. 
This eliminates the need for complex server configurations or cloud services.

Use the following SSH command to set up a tunnel to your local development server:

```bash
ssh -p 443 -R0:localhost:8000 qr@a.pinggy.io
```

{{< pinggytunnel box="true" tunnelstring="Paste this command to start a tunnel to FastAPI:" portstring="FastAPI Port" localport="8000" webdebugenabled=false keepalive=true >}}
{{< /pinggytunnel >}}

Note: Replace the port 8000 in the command with the port where your local development server is running.

After running the command, Pinggy will generate a public URL which might looks like this:

```
http://rnnex-2405-201-800b-489d-7063-516b-6c80-5d24.a.free.pinggy.link
```

> Add the endpoint after this link to get the required output.
> Say for getting cpu uage informtion, the link would be like

```
http://rnnex-2405-201-800b-489d-7063-516b-6c80-5d24.a.free.pinggy.link/cpu
```

{{< image "system_monitoring_fastapi/pinggy_command_img.webp" "Pinggy command" >}}

When you paste the modified URL into your browser, your FastAPI application will process the request and return the output in JSON format, which will be displayed directly in the browser.

Output would look like:-
