#### Cons
- **Single Host Limitation:**  
  Only the host machine handles rendering. This makes it unsuitable for games that require distributed processing.
- **Not a Full Game Server:**  
  It’s meant for streaming rather than running a persistent, multi-user game server.

#### Why Consider It?
Parsec excels when you want to share your gaming experience directly from your PC without exposing a game server. Its high performance and low latency make it perfect for inviting a friend or small group into a real-time gaming session without dealing with complex network configurations.



### B. Cloud Gaming Services (GeForce Now, Shadow)
#### What They Offer
- **Cloud-Based Gaming:**  
  Services like {{< link href="https://play.geforcenow.com/mall/#/loginwall" >}}GeForce Now{{< /link >}} and {{< link href="https://shadow.tech/" >}}Shadow{{< /link >}} allow you to stream games from powerful remote servers, eliminating the need for high-end local hardware.
- **Hardware Offloading:**  
  The heavy lifting is done in the cloud, which is ideal for players with less powerful devices or for those who wish to play graphically demanding games without investing in new hardware.

#### Pros
- **Accessibility:**  
  Ideal for users with lower-end PCs, tablets, or even smartphones.
- **Consistent Performance:**  
  Cloud gaming can provide a consistent experience if you have a stable and fast internet connection.

#### Cons
- **Subscription Costs:**  
  Cloud gaming services typically require monthly subscriptions.
- **Additional Latency:**  
  The extra hop to the cloud server may introduce some latency, which might be noticeable in fast-paced games.

#### Why Consider Them?
Cloud gaming services are perfect if you want to offload hardware requirements or if your local machine struggles with high-end games. They aren’t a direct replacement for a local game server but are excellent for streaming your games to devices that otherwise couldn’t run them.
