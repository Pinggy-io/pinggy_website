## What is the NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID Error?
The **NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID** error indicates that your browser cannot verify the authenticity of a website’s SSL/TLS certificate. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificates guarantee that an establishment of communication between browsers and a particular site is safe and encrypted. This status usually suggests that the certificate used in the website is self-generated, has run out, is set up incorrectly, or is created by an unauthorized authority.

## For Website Visitors: Why Does This Error Matter?
The **NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID** error is more than just a technical inconvenience—it’s a warning sign about the security of your connection to a website. When this error appears, your browser is alerting you that it cannot verify the legitimacy of the website’s SSL/TLS certificate, which is critical for encrypting your data during online interactions. Ignoring this warning could put your sensitive information, such as passwords, financial details, or personal data, at risk.

### Common Reasons You See the Error

#### 1. Untrusted Certificate Authority
The organisation in charge of providing SSL/TLS certificates is known as the certificate authority (CA). A certificate must be issued by a reputable CA in order to be accepted as legitimate. Your browser will mark a website as possibly unsafe if it utilises a certificate that is self-signed or comes from an unreliable source. This is a typical problem with internal company systems or tiny websites.

#### 2. Expired or Revoked Certificate
Like most certificates, SSL/TLS certificates have an expiration date. If the website’s owner does not renew the certificate on time, the browser will not accept it anymore. Similarly, if the certificate is compromised or misused, the Certificate Authority (CA) revokes it, causing this error. Additionally, an incorrect system date or time on your device can lead the browser to believe the certificate has expired. Ensure the date and time are accurate in such cases

#### 3. Mismatched Certificate Details
An SSL/TLS certificate holds certain information, one of which is the domain name it is issued to. For example, if the URL of the site is `www.moksh.com`, but the certificate is issued for `moksh.com` (or vice versa), the browser will display an error message to inform the user of the mismatch. This is a security measure to ensure that the certificate corresponds exactly to the domain being

#### 4. Outdated Browser
Browsers depend on the presence of the latest libraries for identity of trusted CA and encryption algorithms. This error can also occur if your browser is out of date: it could be that the browser is not equipped to validate newer forms of certificates.

### How to Resolve the NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID Issue as a Visitor

## For Website Owners: Understanding the Problem

The **NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID** error isn’t just a technical issue; it’s a barrier to user trust and website functionality. Any time this error occurs, potential customers are reminded not to believe in your site hence they will not stay to read any content or use the services you offer. This has a direct influence on your traffic, search engine ranking, and company reputation. It is important for any individual and business to be aware of this problem and be able to address it to ensure they have a safe, optimized, and polished online presence.

### Why Your Website Shows the Error
The error occurs due to problems with your SSL/TLS certificate, which ensures encrypted communication between your website and its visitors. Here are the common causes:

#### 1. Expired Certificates
They have a limited lifetime that is usually ranges from 90 days up to several years. If this certificate is not renewed before it gets to its expiry date then the browser will recognize it as a non-existent one. Certificates that are expired give the perception that the issuer is lazy and this is not the kind of perception you would want to give to your potential visitors.

#### 2. Self-Signed Certificates
Self-signed certificates are produced by the owner of the website rather than a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). While they are simple to create and free of charge, browsers don’t trust them because they lack external approval. These certificates are suitable for development environments or internal networks but should not be used on public websites.

For public websites, consider obtaining a free SSL certificate from  {{< link href=" https://letsencrypt.org/">}} Let’s Encrypt {{</link>}}.{{< link href=" https://letsencrypt.org/">}} Let’s Encrypt {{</link>}} provides certificates trusted by all major browsers, ensuring your site is secure and user-friendly.

#### 3. Misconfiguration
Incorrectly installing or configuring your certificate can result in mismatches between the certificate and your domain. Common issues include:
- The certificate being issued for a different domain (e.g., "example.com" vs. "www.example.com").
- Using a wildcard certificate improperly.
- Incorrect settings in your web server configuration (e.g., Apache, NGINX).

#### 4. Missing Intermediate Certificates
By using SSL/TLS certificates, users have to stay connected by creating a chain of trust between your certificate and the root certificate. If you don’t have the intermediate certificates that connect your site to the root, browsers cannot verify the authenticity of your certificate.

### How to Resolve the NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID Issue as a Website Owner

Resolving this error requires addressing the root cause. Here’s a detailed step-by-step guide:

#### 1. Use a Trusted Certificate Authority
- Purchase your SSL/TLS certificate from a reputable CA such as {{< link href="https://www.digicert.com/">}} DigiCert {{</link>}}, {{< link href="https://www.globalsign.com/en">}} GlobalSign {{</link>}}, or {{< link href="https://www.sectigo.com/">}} Sectigo {{</link>}}.
- For free and widely trusted options, consider using {{< link href=" https://letsencrypt.org/">}} Let’s Encrypt {{</link>}}, which provides automated certificate issuance.
- Avoid self-signed certificates unless for local development or internal use.
**Pro Tip:** Some hosting providers (e.g., Bluehost, SiteGround) include free SSL certificates in their plans. Check with your provider before purchasing separately.
#### 2. Renew Expired Certificates
- Monitor the expiration date of your SSL/TLS certificate and renew it before it expires.
- Most CAs send email reminders as the expiration date approaches. Set additional reminders in your calendar to ensure timely action.
- If using Let’s Encrypt, implement automatic renewal using tools like Certbot.
#### 3. Verify Certificate Installation
- Ensure your certificate is properly installed on your server. Incorrect installation can lead to errors.
- Use tools like {{< link href="https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html" >}}SSL Checker{{< /link >}} or {{< link href="https://www.whynopadlock.com/" >}}Whynopadlock{{< /link >}} to verify your SSL setup.
- Confirm that your web server (e.g., Apache, NGINX) is configured correctly to serve the certificate.
#### 4. Fix Domain Mismatch
- Check that the certificate details match your domain name exactly. For example:
  - A certificate for "www.example.com" will not work for "example.com" unless a wildcard or SAN (Subject Alternative Name) certificate is used.
- If you’ve recently updated your domain (e.g., adding or removing “www”), ensure your certificate reflects the changes.
- Reissue the certificate with the correct domain details if necessary.
#### 5. Install Intermediate Certificates
- Obtain the intermediate certificates from your CA and add them to your server.
- Verify that your server sends the complete certificate chain to browsers. Missing intermediate certificates will cause browsers to distrust the connection.
- Use tools like {{< link href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/" >}}SSL Labs{{< /link >}}  to check if the chain of trust is complete.
#### 6. Enable Automatic Certificate Renewal
- Automate certificate renewals to avoid expiration issues, especially if using Let’s Encrypt.
- Tools like Certbot, ZeroSSL, or acme.sh can automate both issuance and renewal processes.
- For paid certificates, inquire whether your hosting provider offers managed SSL services to handle renewals automatically.
#### 7. Test SSL Configuration
- After making changes, test your SSL/TLS configuration to ensure it’s secure and error-free:
- Use {{< link href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/" >}}Qualys SSL Labs{{< /link >}} to analyze your configuration for weaknesses.
- Look for an "A" grade or higher to ensure your SSL implementation is robust.
- Verify that HTTP is redirected to HTTPS, ensuring all traffic is secure.

By resolving the **NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID** error, you can rebuild visitor trust, improve user experience, and strengthen your website’s SEO performance. Addressing SSL issues is not just a technical necessity—it’s a cornerstone of building credibility in today’s online ecosystem.

## Impact of NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID on SEO
