## Which Networking and Security Companies Are Future-Proof?

If you’re a dev or a tech-savvy investor, you know not every networking company is built to ride the next wave. Out of this list, **Cisco, Arista, Palo Alto Networks, and Fortinet** are the ones which will probably stay relevant. Cisco might feel old-school, but it still runs nearly half the world’s enterprise switches (about 40% market share) and is finally getting serious about recurring software - last year, subscriptions were 44% of their revenue. Arista is quietly crushing it in hyperscale data centers - the same racks that power AI - with revenue up 33% in 2023 alone. Then there’s security: Palo Alto and Fortinet are the go-to names when it comes to locking down networks, and with cyber threats exploding, both are growing faster than the market (25% and 20% revenue jumps last year). Meanwhile, companies like NETGEAR and Aviat are stuck fighting for scraps in crowded hardware corners. If you’re coding or investing for the next decade, bet on the ones wiring up AI, cloud, and secure everything.



## Conclusion

The US computer networking industry continues to evolve rapidly, with market leaders adapting to new technologies and changing customer needs. While Cisco maintains its dominant position, specialized companies like Arista Networks and Palo Alto Networks have achieved significant valuations by focusing on high-growth segments.

The industry's future will likely be shaped by continued investments in cloud infrastructure, AI capabilities, and integrated security solutions. Companies that successfully navigate these trends while maintaining strong execution are positioned for continued growth and market leadership.

As network infrastructure becomes increasingly critical to business operations, these companies play a vital role in enabling the digital economy and supporting the next generation of technological innovation.
