{{< link href="https://ngrok.com" >}}Ngrok{{< /link >}} is an ingress-as-a-service that provides tunnels facilitating instant ingress to your apps in any cloud, private network, or device. Using Ngrok tunnels you can share your website / app from your localhost. It has many other use cases, such as connecting to IoT devices behind NAT and firewall, receiving webhooks, debugging HTTP requests, and more. Recently, ngrok has expanded its offerings to API gateway, firewall, and load balancing to host on-premise apps and services.
Although very mature, Ngrok has its own limitations of being a complex ingress-as-a-service.

In this article, we will explore the **best 10 alternatives of Ngrok in 2025**. We will cover the features, installation process, ease of use and pricing of the Ngrok alternatives to help you choose the best one.

## Overview of Ngrok

Before jumping into the alternatives for Ngrok, we will have a brief overview of Ngrok itself.

Ngrok provides tunnels for ingress through its programmable network edge. It offers HTTPS, TCP, and TLS tunnels. It provides observability as well as the ability to change traffic parameters such as headers on the go to your apps with no code changes. In order to use Ngrok you must download the Ngrok client and sign up to get an account. In the paid plans you get features such as webhook verification, OAuth authentication, custom domain, persistent TCP port, etc.

#### Pros of Ngrok

#### Ngrok price

Ngrok starts at $8 per month for the “Personal” plan, which provides one persistent domain and TCP port. It has a bandwidth cap of 1GB per month. The “Pro” plan, priced at $20 per month, offers features such as IP whitelisting and unlimited webhook verification. It charges $0.10/GB for bandwidth exceeding 1GB per month.

## 1. Pinggy.io

[Pinggy.io](https://pinggy.io) is a tunneling tool that gives a public address to access your localhost, even while sitting behind a NAT or a firewall -- all this in a single command. With this Ngrok alternative, without downloading anything, a single command gives users access to your website / app hosted in localhost without configuring the cloud, or any port forwarding, or DNS, or VPN.

To get how simple it is to open a tunnel, here is an example. If you want to share your React app running on `localhost:3000`, you can do so using pinggy with the command:

```
ssh -p 443 -R0:localhost:3000 a.pinggy.io
```

{{< link href="https://zrok.io/" >}}Zrok{{< /link >}} is an impressive open source Ngrok alternative that operates on the principles of zero trust networking. Built on top of OpenZiti, a programmable zero trust network overlay, zrok provides users with a secure and efficient way to share resources both publicly and privately.

Users can download zrok from GitHub {{< link href="https://github.com/openziti/zrok/releases/latest" >}}https://github.com/openziti/zrok/releases/latest{{< /link >}}. It is one of the best self-hosted alternatives of Ngrok.

{{< link href="https://localhost.run/" >}}localhost.run{{< /link >}} is possibly the simplest tunneling tool which is client-less and can instantly make a locally running application available on an internet accessible URL.

Just run the following command to create a tunnel to port `3000`:

```
ssh -R 80:localhost:8080 localhost.run
```

#### Pros of localhost.run

- Simplicity: Localhost.run offers a straightforward and simple setup process. You only need to execute a single command in your terminal to start the tunneling process, making it easy for developers to get started quickly.
- No installation required: Unlike Ngrok, which requires installation and configuration, localhost.run doesn't need any software installation. You can use it directly from the command line, which can be convenient, especially for quick testing or prototyping.
- Free to use: localhost.run offers a free tier, allowing you to use the service without any cost.

#### Cons of localhost.run

- Limited features: Compared to Ngrok and other alternatives such as Pinggy, localhost.run may have a significantly more limited set of features. For example, it may not provide advanced functionalities such as custom domains, request inspection, or TCP tunneling.


## 6. Serveo

{{< link href="https://serveo.net/" >}}Serveo{{< /link >}} is another alternative to Ngrok that does not require any client installation. Serveo is "an SSH server just for remote port forwarding". With one ssh command, users can get a URL through which they can expose a port of their localhost.

#### Pros of Serveo

- No client installation required
- Free to use
- No sign up required
- Users can request a subdomain
- Custom domain is also supported

#### Cons of Serveo

## 7. Tailscale

{{< link href="https://tailscale.com/" >}}Tailscale{{< /link >}} is not exactly an Ngrok alternative, rather it is a VPN service. Instead of using a central VPN server employed by traditional VPN services, Tailscale uses a mesh network. The strategy employed by Tailscale prevents centralization whenever feasible. This leads to increased throughput and decreased latency, as machine-to-machine network traffic can move directly. Moreover, opting for decentralization enhances stability and dependability by minimizing instances of singular failure points.

{{< image "best_ngrok_alternatives/tailscale.webp" "tailscale screenshot" >}}

The **Tailscale Funnel** represents a functionality enabling the directing of external internet traffic towards one or multiple nodes within your Tailscale network. This can be likened to the act of openly sharing a node, granting accessibility to anyone, irrespective of their possession of Tailscale.

Using Tailscale Funnel you can achive the functionality of Ngrok.

## 8. Cloudflare Tunnel

{{< link href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/" >}}Cloudflare Tunnel{{< /link >}} allows users to connect their applications and services to cloudflare infrastructure without requiring a public IP address. To use Cloudflare Tunnels, users need to install a daemon called `cloudflared` on their local computer. Cloudflare Tunnels are capable of creating secure connections for various protocols like HTTP web servers, SSH servers, and remote desktops to link to Cloudflare. This ensures that your end-users can route traffic via Cloudflare securely, while preventing attacks.

In the broad scheme of Cloudflare offerings, using Cloudflare Tunnels, organizations can setup Internet-native Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA). Read more about it {{< link href="https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/access/" >}}here{{< /link >}}.

The free version offers up to 4 TCP tunnels and 4 UDP tunnels. The paid version starts from 3 USD per month and offers custom domains and dedicated IP addresses.


## 10. Pagekite

{{< link href="https://pagekite.net/" >}}Pagekite{{< /link >}} has been around for more than 14 years now. It offers HTTP(S) and TCP tunnels. It has built-in IP whitelisting, password auth, and other advanced features. The free tier includes 2 GB of transfer quota per month, as well as custom domains.
