## What Does "dns_probe_finished_nxdomain" Mean?

When your browser cannot find the IP address that the domain you’re trying to reach maps to, you’ll get the error 'dns_probe_finished_nxdomain'. DNS works like a phone book to translate plain english domain names (example.com) to computers friendly IP addresses.

But when this process fails, your browser is unable to find the website and will show you the 'NXDOMAIN' (no such domain) error.

## How to Fix "dns_probe_finished_nxdomain"
This error happens most often because your DNS (Domain Name System) cannot resolve the domain name into an IP address. For normal users who are **website visitors** and **domain owners**, we provide some solutions.

### For Website Visitors
#### 1. Clear Browser Cache and Cookies
The cached data can sometimes conflict with DNS resolution. Clear your browser cache and cookies:

- **For Chrome:**  
    - Clear Browsing Data can be found under Settings → Privacy and Security.
    - From here select "Cached images and files" and "Cookies."
    - Click "Clear Data."

You’re absolutely right; there was redundancy in the previous sections regarding the use of DNS verification tools, particularly the Google DIG Tool. I've consolidated the information to make it more cohesive and readable.

### For Domain Owners

If you’re a domain owner that’s getting the `dns_probe_finished_nxdomain` error, that’s likely because of errors in your domain’s DNS settings. Here's how you can troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

#### 1. Verify Your DNS Records

One fastest way to ensure your domain resolves correctly is to ensure your DNS records are correct. In order for the browser to open the page successfully, the domain has to resolve to an IP address, that is, either an `A` record for IPv4, or an `AAAA` record for IPv6.

- **Use DNS Verification Tools**:
  - {{< link href="https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/" >}}Google Dig Tool{{< /link >}}: Provides detailed DNS record information.
  - {{< link href="https://mxtoolbox.com/" >}}MXToolbox{{< /link >}}: Offers a suite of DNS lookup tools.

- **Steps to Use the Google Dig Tool**:

  1. **Access the Tool**: Visit the {{< link href="https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/" >}}Google Dig Tool{{< /link >}} in your web browser.
  {{< image "dns_probe_finished_nxdomain/homepage.webp" "Google Dig Homepage" >}}
  2. **Enter Your Domain Name**: In the "Hostnames or IP addresses" field, type your domain name (e.g., `pinggy.io`). Double-check for typos to ensure accuracy.
  3. **Select DNS Record Type**:
     - From the dropdown menu, choose the DNS record type you want to query:
       - **A Record**: Checks IPv4 address mapping.
       - **AAAA Record**: Checks IPv6 address mapping (if applicable).
       - **CNAME Record**: Verifies domain aliases.
       - **MX Record**: Checks mail server configurations.
       > Note: `A` records and `AAAA` records are necessary for the browser to reach the website.
  4. **Analyze the Results**:
     - **Successful Resolution**:
       - The correct DNS records are displayed with expected values.
       - Ensure the IP addresses match those provided by your hosting provider.
       {{< image "dns_probe_finished_nxdomain/search_pinggy_io.webp" "Search Pinggy.io" >}}
     - **Error - NXDOMAIN**:
       - Indicates the domain does not exist in DNS.
       - Suggests missing or incorrect DNS records.
       {{< image "dns_probe_finished_nxdomain/error_page.webp" "Google Dig tool Error Page" >}}

- **What to Look For**:

  - **Accuracy**: Confirm that all IP addresses and domain names are correct.
  - **Existence**: Missing records (like A or AAAA) can cause resolution failures.
  - **Response Codes**: An `NXDOMAIN` response points to potential misconfigurations.

- **Action Steps**:

  - **If Issues Are Found**:
    - Log in to your domain registrar or DNS hosting provider's dashboard.
    - Update or add the necessary DNS records:
      - **A Record**: Should point to your server's correct IPv4 address.
      - **AAAA Record**: If using IPv6, ensure it points to the correct IPv6 address.
    - Save changes. Remember, DNS propagation can take up to 24-48 hours.

#### 2. Check Domain Registration Status

An expired domain won't resolve, leading to DNS errors.
- **How to Check**:
  - Perform a {{< link href="https://whois.domaintools.com/" >}}WHOIS Lookup{{< /link >}} to view your domain's expiration date and registration status.
  - Ensure your domain is active and not suspended or expired.
- **Next Steps**:
    - Regardless, renew your domain registration right away through your registrar.
    - Change contact and billing information in case there’s a lapse in the future.

#### 3. Allow Time for DNS Propagation

Changes to DNS settings aren't instantaneous.
- **Understanding Propagation**:
  - DNS can take anywhere from a few mins, a few hours, up to 48 hours to spread globally.
  - During this period of time, some users will continue to face the error.
- **Monitoring Tools**:
  - Use {{< link href="https://dnschecker.org/" >}} DNS Checker {{< /link >}} to track propagation status across different regions.
  - This helps you see where the updated DNS records have taken effect.

#### 4. Investigate Issues with Your Registrar

Sometimes, the problem isn't with your DNS settings but with the registrar.

- **Steps to Take**:
  - Contact your domain registrar's support team.
  - Confirm that your domain is properly configured on their end.
  - Ensure there are no holds, suspensions, or restrictions on your domain.

#### 5. Verify Custom Nameserver Configurations

If you’re using custom nameservers, they must be properly setup.
- **Action Items**:
  - **Check Nameserver Settings**:
    - Check your custom nameservers are correct tied to your domain in your Registrar Dashboard.
  - **Validate Nameserver Functionality**:
    - Confirm that your nameservers are operational and responding to DNS queries.
  - **Verify DNS Records on Nameservers**:
    - Go to your nameserver’s control panel and log in.
    - Make sure you’ve created all DNS records needed (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX).

## How to Fix "dns_probe_finished_nxdomain" in Pinggy Tunnels

### 1. Check Tunnel Status
- Verify that your [Pinggy](https://pinggy.io/) tunnel is active and running.view all active tunnels on the [Pinggy Dashboard](https://dashboard.pinggy.io/activetunnels).

- If the tunnel stops or becomes disabled, the public URL will no longer be accessible, resulting in a DNS error.

**Solution**: Restart the Pinggy tunnel with the same command if needed.
{{< ssh_command defaultcommand="ssh -p 443 -R0:localhost:8080 a.pinggy.io" >}}
"{\"cli\":{\"windows\":{\"ps\":\"./pinggy.exe -p 443 -R0:localhost:8080 a.pinggy.io\",\"cmd\":\"./pinggy.exe -p 443 -R0:localhost:8080 a.pinggy.io\"},\"linux\":{\"ps\":\"./pinggy -p 443 -R0:localhost:8080 a.pinggy.io\",\"cmd\":\"./pinggy -p 443 -R0:localhost:8080 a.pinggy.io\"}},\"ssh\":{\"windows\":{\"ps\":\"ssh -p 443 -R0:localhost:8080 a.pinggy.io\",\"cmd\":\"ssh -p 443 -R0:localhost:8080 a.pinggy.io\"},\"linux\":{\"ps\":\"ssh -p 443 -R0:localhost:8080 a.pinggy.io\",\"cmd\":\"ssh -p 443 -R0:localhost:8080 a.pinggy.io\"}}}"
{{</ ssh_command >}}

### 2. Verify Public URL
- Each time you start a tunnel, Pinggy generates a unique public URL (e.g., `https://rnuma-14-139-241-203.a.free.pinggy.link`).
- Ensure you’re using the correct, current URL.

**Solution**: When you start the tunnel with Pinggy, copy the public URL displayed, save it, and use it to access your server. You can also use the QR code of the URL if provided for quick access.

### 3. Check Network Connectivity
- Pinggy may lose connection if your internet is weak or unstable, leading to DNS errors.
- Confirm your internet connection is working and stable.

**Solution**: If you suspect network issues, restart your modem/router or try connecting via a different network for troubleshooting.
