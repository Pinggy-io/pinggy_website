title: "DNS load balancing"
description: "DNS load balancing is a technique used to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers by leveraging the Domain Name System (DNS). When a user requests a domain, the DNS resolver provides different IP addresses corresponding to multiple servers, ensuring that the traffic is evenly distributed. This approach enhances application performance, scalability, and reliability by reducing server overload and improving response times. It also supports fault tolerance, as traffic can be rerouted to healthy servers in case of server failures. DNS load balancing is widely used for web applications, content delivery networks, and high-traffic platforms."

## **DNS Resolution** Process with **Load Balancing**

To understand **DNS load balancing** more clearly, let’s break down how **DNS resolution** works and how it’s adapted to distribute traffic:

1. **DNS Query Initiation**: When a user types a **domain name** (e.g., `example.com`) in their browser, a **DNS query** is initiated.
   
2. **DNS Resolver**: The request goes to the **DNS resolver**, which is typically provided by the user's **ISP** or a third-party service (e.g., **Google DNS**). The resolver’s job is to translate the **domain name** into an **IP address**.

3. **Authoritative DNS Server**: The resolver queries the **authoritative DNS server** for the domain. This server holds the domain’s **DNS records**, such as **A** (Address) records that map **domain names** to **IP addresses**.

4. **Multiple IP Addresses Returned**: In **DNS load balancing**, the authoritative **DNS server** is configured to return multiple **IP addresses** for a domain. These **IP addresses** correspond to different **servers** or instances that can handle incoming requests.

5. **IP Selection by DNS Resolver**: The **DNS resolver** selects one of the returned **IP addresses** (based on the load balancing technique) and forwards it to the user's device. The browser then connects to the **server** corresponding to that **IP address**.

**Example**:  
Let's assume we have a domain `example.com` associated with three **servers** with the following **IP addresses**:

- **IP1**: `192.168.1.10`
- **IP2**: `192.168.1.11`
- **IP3**: `192.168.1.12`

When a user queries `example.com`, the **DNS server** might return all three **IP addresses**. The **DNS resolver** selects one based on the **load balancing** mechanism in place.

## Types of **DNS Load Balancing** Techniques

There are various **DNS load balancing** methods, each suitable for different use cases. Below we’ll look at some of the most common techniques, and illustrate how different **IP addresses** are used in each method.

### 1. **Round-Robin DNS**

**Round-Robin DNS** is the most basic and widely-used **DNS load balancing** technique. The authoritative **DNS server** returns multiple **IP addresses** for a **domain**, and the **DNS resolver** selects one in a rotating manner.

**How **Round-Robin DNS** Works:**

1. **DNS Server Setup**: The domain `example.com` has three **A records** with the following **IPs**:
   - `192.168.1.10` (Server 1)
   - `192.168.1.11` (Server 2)
   - `192.168.1.12` (Server 3)

2. **DNS Resolution**: When a user queries `example.com`, the authoritative **DNS server** returns the list of **IPs** in the following order:  
   - First request: `192.168.1.10`
   - Second request: `192.168.1.11`
   - Third request: `192.168.1.12`
   - Fourth request: `192.168.1.10` (cycle repeats)

3. **Traffic Distribution**: Each user query is directed to a different **server** based on the **round-robin** mechanism, helping to balance the load between the **servers**.

**Example of IP Address Rotation**:
- **User 1**: Resolves `example.com` to `192.168.1.10` (Server 1)
- **User 2**: Resolves `example.com` to `192.168.1.11` (Server 2)
- **User 3**: Resolves `example.com` to `192.168.1.12` (Server 3)
- **User 4**: Resolves `example.com` to `192.168.1.10` (Server 1 again)

**Limitation**: This technique does not account for **server load** or availability. If a **server** (e.g., `192.168.1.10`) goes down, users could still be routed to it.

### 2. **Weighted Round-Robin DNS**

In **Weighted Round-Robin DNS**, different **IP addresses** are assigned different **weights** based on their **capacity**. **Servers** with higher capacity or performance will receive a higher share of traffic.

**How **Weighted Round-Robin DNS** Works:**

1. **DNS Server Setup**: The domain `example.com` is associated with the following **IP addresses**, where **Server 1** has more capacity than the others:
   - `192.168.1.10` (Server 1) — weight 3
   - `192.168.1.11` (Server 2) — weight 2
   - `192.168.1.12` (Server 3) — weight 1

2. **DNS Resolution**: When a user queries `example.com`, the authoritative **DNS server** returns the **IP addresses** in the following pattern:
   - The **DNS resolver** will prioritize **IP1** (Server 1) more frequently than the other **servers**.
   - The selection may look like this:
     - First request: `192.168.1.10` (Server 1)
     - Second request: `192.168.1.10` (Server 1)
     - Third request: `192.168.1.11` (Server 2)
     - Fourth request: `192.168.1.10` (Server 1)
     - Fifth request: `192.168.1.12` (Server 3)

**Example of Traffic Distribution**:
- **Server 1** (IP `192.168.1.10`) will receive 3 out of every 6 requests.
- **Server 2** (IP `192.168.1.11`) will receive 2 out of every 6 requests.
- **Server 3** (IP `192.168.1.12`) will receive 1 out of every 6 requests.

**Benefit**: This approach ensures that more powerful **servers** handle a larger share of the traffic.

{{< image "dns_loadbalancing/Weighted_Round-Robin_DNS.webp" "Weighted Round-Robin DNS is a DNS load balancing method that distributes requests across multiple servers based on assigned weights, allowing more traffic to be routed to higher-capacity servers." >}}

### 3. **Geographic DNS Load Balancing**

**Geographic Load Balancing** uses the user's **location** to direct them to the nearest **server**. This reduces **latency** by routing users to the closest available **server**.

**How **Geographic DNS Load Balancing** Works:**

1. **DNS Server Setup**: Multiple **data centers** are set up in different geographical regions with the following **IP addresses**:
   - **US East**: `192.168.1.10` (Server 1)
   - **US West**: `192.168.1.11` (Server 2)
   - **Europe**: `192.168.1.12` (Server 3)
   - **Asia**: `192.168.1.13` (Server 4)

2. **DNS Resolution**: When a user from the United States queries `example.com`, they will receive the **IP address** of the closest **server**:
   - User from the **East Coast** (e.g., New York) resolves to `192.168.1.10` (US East).
   - User from the **West Coast** (e.g., California) resolves to `192.168.1.11` (US West).
   - User from **Europe** resolves to `192.168.1.12` (Europe).
   - User from **Asia** resolves to `192.168.1.13` (Asia).

**Example of IP Address Assignment Based on Location**:
- **User 1 (New York)**: Resolves to `192.168.1.10` (US East)
- **User 2 (California)**: Resolves to `192.168.1.11` (US West)
- **User 3 (Berlin)**: Resolves to `192.168.1.12` (Europe)
- **User 4 (Tokyo)**: Resolves to `192.168.1.13` (Asia)

**Benefit**: **Geographic load balancing** minimizes **latency** and provides better **user experience** by serving users from the nearest **data center**.

### 4. **DNS Load Balancing with Health Checks**

**Health-based DNS load balancing** involves using **health checks** to ensure traffic is only routed to **servers** that are online and responsive. If a **server** goes down, **DNS** will no longer return its **IP address** in the list.

**How **Health Check-based DNS** Works:**

1. **DNS Server Setup**: The domain `example.com` is configured with multiple **servers** and health monitoring in place.
   - `192.168.1.10` (Server 1)
   - `192.168.1.11` (Server 2)
   - `192.168.1.12` (Server 3)

2. **Health Checks**: The **DNS server** periodically checks the health of each **server**. If **Server 2** (`192.168.1.11`) goes down, the **DNS server** will stop returning this **IP address** in subsequent **DNS queries**.

3. **DNS Resolution**:
   - Initially, the **DNS server** returns all three **IPs** (`192.168.1.10`, `192.168.1.11`, `192.168.1.12`).
   - If **Server 2** goes down, the **DNS server** only returns the remaining healthy **IPs**.

**Benefit**: This ensures that requests are only routed to functioning **servers**, improving **reliability** and **availability**.
