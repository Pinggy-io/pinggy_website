Ngrok is an excellent tool loved by developers worldwide. If you need to expose your localhost server, Ngrok comes in handy. However, utilizing Ngrok requires downloading a platform-specific program (binary) for your operating system, be it Mac, Windows, or Linux. Subsequently, you must make the binary executable and launch it from the terminal. This process of obtaining Ngrok can often be cumbersome.
