# Persistent Subdomain

Pinggy assigns random URLs for **free** tunnels, such as `rnskg-21-24-129-38.a.free.pinggy.link`.

If you want a URL that does not change every time you create a new tunnel, you need to <a target="_blank" href="https://pinggy.io/#prices">upgrade to Pinggy Pro</a>.

Once you have upgraded to Pinggy Pro, log in to <a target="_blank" href="https://dashboard.pinggy.io/">https://dashboard.pinggy.io/</a>. In the dashboard, you will find your access token.


Example:

{{< ssh_command text="xGBTh6cy58q" >}}
"{}"
{{</ ssh_command >}}


The dashboard will also contain commands to start a tunnel using your token. A simple example Pinggy command using your token is as follows:

```bash
ssh -p 443 -R0:localhost:8000 xGBTh6cy58q@a.pinggy.io
```

# Configure Persistent Subdomain


In order to configure your persistent subdomain, first visit  <a target="_blank" href="https://dashboard.pinggy.io/subdomains">https://dashboard.pinggy.io/subdomains</a>.

There, you will find a list of access tokens and their subdomains. Click on the **Edit** button to edit your persistent subdomain.

After the subdomain is configured, start or restart your tunnel with the token to get the new persistent URL.

Note that if you have already configured a custom domain for your token, you will need to delete the custom domain configuration first in order to change the subdomain.
