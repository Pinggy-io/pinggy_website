# Usages

Pinggy uses the reverse tunneling feature provided by the secure-shell (`ssh`) program. One can use any `ssh` program as long as it provides the reverse tunneling feature. However, we recommend using `openssh` whenever possible.

Pinggy utilizes different features of the `ssh` protocol to provide different functionalities like web debugging, header manipulation, authentication, etc.
We directly use the options provided by the `ssh` command to set the tunnel and enable the live debugging.
Tunnel tokens and a few keywords are sent as the username. Few command line options to configure different options for the tunnel.

Let's start with basic ssh options:

## ssh usages
Detailed usages are available on `ssh` man page at <https://man.openbsd.org/ssh>

```
ssh -p443 -R0:<localhost>:<localport> [<token/keyword/tunneltype>@]a.pinggy.io <remote options>
```

<table markdown="1">
<tr><td colspan=2>
-R remoteport:localaddress:localport
</td><tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>
Expose a local service running on localaddress:localport to remoteport. There are multiple variations of reverse tunneling. However, Pinggy supports only this version.

Pinggy ignores the remote port and assigns a domain name and port as per the subscription and tunnel type.
</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan=2>
-p port
</td><tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>

Remote server port. By default `ssh` servers listen on port 22. However,  Pinggy servers listen on 443 to overcome firewall restrictions in some networks. So, use `-p443` while connecting to a Pinggy server.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>
-t
</td><tr markdown="1">
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td markdown="1">

Force pseudo-terminal allocation. By default `ssh` command requests for pseudo-terminal as long as there is no `remote option` provided.

Pinggy uses pseudo-terminal to provide a rich interface like this.

<tr><td>&nbsp</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>
-T
</td><tr markdown="1">
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td markdown="1">
Disable pseudo-terminal. Pinggy works without a pseudo-terminal and provides basic information.

<tr><td colspan=2>
-N
</td><tr markdown="1">
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td markdown="1">
Disable remote command execution.

Pinggy uses remote command execution to enable advanced functionalities including web debugging, header manipulations, and many more. It is not recommended to use this flag.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2>
-L <localport>:localhost:4300
</td><tr markdown="1">
<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td markdown="1">

Enable local forwarding. It enables `ssh` client to listen on `localport` and forward incoming connections to the remote port.

Pinggy only allows forwarding to port 4300. Where it provides web debugging UI.

## Username to ssh
Pinggy does not require any username or authentication to start the tunnel as it does not provide any access to the server. However, this information goes to the server before `ssh` could establish the connection. So, we use the username to send tunnel `token` and other keywords to the server. `token` can be found in <dashboard.pinggy.io>. `token` and keywords are separated by `+`. Pinggy has following keywords:

#### 1. http/tcp/tls/tlstcp
These keywords set the tunnel type. The default tunnel is the `http` type.
##### a) http
The `http` tunnel works only with the HTTP server. Pinggy provides links for both HTTP and HTTPS, however, it terminates traffic at the server and read it to provide live debugging and other functionalities. Any `http` tunnel comes with the following functionalities.
* Live Header Manipulation
* Basic Authentication
* Key Authentication
* IP White Listing
More about these functionalities later.

A basic `http` tunnel can be started using
{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Without Token" %}}
```
ssh -R0:localhost:<localport> a.pinggy.io
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="With Token" %}}
```
ssh -R0:localhost:<localport> <token>@a.pinggy.io
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}
##### b) tcp
`tcp` tunnel is the simplest form of tunnel. It simply forward incoming data without doing any kind of processing. `tcp` tunnel also provides a server port. All the `tcp` tunnel also comes with *IP White Listing* functionality.

A basic `tcp` tunnel can be started using
{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Without Token" %}}
```
ssh -R0:localhost:<localport> tcp@a.pinggy.io
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="With Token" %}}
```
ssh -R0:localhost:<localport> <token>+tcp@a.pinggy.io
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

##### c) tls
`tls` tunnel is equivalent to `tcp` tunnel with only one exception, the server does not allocate any TCP port, instead it forward incoming SSL/TLS traffic based on the `server name indication` or `SNI`. Instead of terminating a TLS/SSL traffic in `tls` tunnel, a Pinggy server forwards the traffic as it is to the client.

Basic `tls` tunnel can be started using
{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Without Token" %}}
```
ssh -R0:localhost:<localport> tls@a.pinggy.io
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="With Token" %}}
```
ssh -R0:localhost:<localport> <token>+tls@a.pinggy.io
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

**In perspective with privacy, a `tls` tunnel is the most private tunnel where Pinggy can't even look at the tunnel content. It also makes it hard for the client, as it has to handle everything about the TLS.**

##### d) tlstcp
`tlstcp` tunnel is a `tcp` tunnel with an option to `tls` wrapper for the visitor. It provides a TCP port where the Pinggy server listens for incoming TCP connections and forwards the content as it is to the client. It also provides a `tls` URL, where it listens at port 443 and terminates the incoming SSL connection and forward the plain text content to the client.

Basic `tlstcp` tunnel can be started using
{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Without Token" %}}
```
ssh -R0:localhost:<localport> tlstcp@a.pinggy.io
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="With Token" %}}
```
ssh -R0:localhost:<localport> <token>+tlstcp@a.pinggy.io
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

**`tlstcp` is similar to `tcp` tunnel with a convenience for visitors to connect to Pinggy server with an SSL connection.**

It will allow a visitor behind a firewall to connect to a TCP-based service hosted on the Pinggy.

*Passing multiple tunnel types is not recommended. The behavior is undefined.*

#### 2. qr/aqr
Pinggy provides an option to display a QR Code with the URL in the terminal. The `qr` key display a smaller unicode base QR Code on the terminal while `aqr` draws a larger ASCII-only QR code. Start a `http` tunnel with QR Code as follows:
{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Without Token" %}}
```
ssh -R0:localhost:<localport> qr@a.pinggy.io
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="With Token" %}}
```
ssh -R0:localhost:<localport> <token>+qr@a.pinggy.io
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

#### 3. auth
Pinggy by default tries to start a tunnel without any authentication. However, it may not works always due to the limitation of some ssh client (e.g. dropbear) implementation. Use `auth` keyword to stop this behavior. With this keyword, a client may ask for a password, kindly provide 0000 (or any string).

#### 4. force
Pinggy provides `force` keyword to forcefully disconnect existing tunnel with the same token before creating a new connection Use it as follows:
```
ssh -R0:localhost:<localport> <token>+force@a.pinggy.io
```
It is useful only with token based connection.

## Command line options
Pinggy has options to configure live HTTP header manipulation, HTTP authentication, and IP whitelisting in the command line only.
Syntax for a command line option is as follows
```
command[:CommandOption1[:CommandOption2...]]
```
Here is the list of command line options.

#### 1. Live HTTP Header Manipulation
##### Add header
```
a:HeaderName:HeaderValue
```
It will add a header with `HeaderName` and `HeaderValue` with every HTTP request. One can put as many add the header as one want.

##### Remove header
```
r:HeaderName
```
It would remove every header with the header name `HeaderName` from the HTTP request. Redunt remove header commands are silently ignored.

##### Update header
```
u:HeaderName:HeaderValue
```
It is the combination of remove header and add header commands. It would remove every header with the header name `HeaderName` and put a new header with the header name `HeaderName` and value `HeaderValue`.

#### 2. Basic Authentication
Pinggy supports basic authentication for the visitor. It is username-password-based authentication that a browser asks for while visiting the website. The syntax to set basic authentication is as follows
```
b:username:password
```
It never sends basic auth to the client.

#### 3. Key Authentication
Key authentication is a mechanism where a visitor send an `Authorisation` header with the value `Bearer <key>`. The request will be passed to the client only if the Key matches the provided one. The syntax to set the key is as follows:
```
k:key
```

*Basic authentication and key authentication can be used together.*

#### 4. IP White Listing
IP White Listing is a feature where visitors from certain `IP` addresses are allowed to connect. It ignores requests from other IP addresses without responding.

The syntax to set IP white list is as follows
```
w:[IP1[,IP2[,IP3..]]]
```

#### 5. Enforce HTTPS only
Pinggy now provides support for `HTTPS` only tunneling. Here, the content will the served over `HTTPS` only. Pinggy server. redirect any request to `HTTPS`. User can enable this feature using following command line argument.
```
x:https
```
The `tls` connection would terminate at the pinggy server only. The plain text data would be sent to client.

#### 6. X-Forwarded-For header in the http request
`X-Forwarded-For` is a mechanism to finding out the source of the connection. Pinggy `http` tunnel does not implicitly add the this flag. However, user can enable `X-Forwarded-For` header with following command line option.
```
x:xff[:<Header Name>]
```
`X-Forwarded-For` is the default header name. However one can add any header name as they want.

#### 7. Original request url
As pinggy mangles header, it is difficult for the client to understand the real url from the request. Pinggy can provide them if user provide the following argument.
```
x:fullurl
```
If this option is provided in the command line option, Pinggy would add a extra header `X-Pinggy-Url` which contains the original url for that request.

#### 8. Run tls locally
By default, we assume that the local server is a TCP server (except for **TLS** tunnels). However, just in case a user wants to run the local server as a `TLS` (for example, `HTTPS`) server, Pinggy can set up a `TLS` connection from the server. You can use the following option:
```
x:localServerTls[:serverName]
```
This option assumes that the local server expects a `TLS` connection. So, Pinggy will create a `TLS` connection to the client server instead. serverName is the SNI for the `TLS` connection. This is optional. By default, the Pinggy server provides SNI as `localhost`.

#### 9. Pass preflight requests
In several cases, browser send preflight request before sending actually. The website never have any control over the prefight request and if it fails, original request won't be made by the browser. Pinggy by default process request and response headers. However, it might be problem for preflight requests. Pinggy can detect preflight request and pass them without modification with following option:
```
x:passpreflight
```

#### 10. Reverse Proxy Mode
Pinggy now supports reverse proxy which it puts `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-Host`, and `Forwarded` headers in the http requests. This is enabled by default for HTTP(S) tunnels. But to disable it, pass the `x:noreverseproxy` argument.

```
x:noreverseproxy
```

* Currently reverse proxy mode is supported only for `http` tunnel. It will be supported for tlstcp in future.


**Kindly note that a Pinggy server does not run any command in the remote server. It uses command line options to configure the tunnel.**
