# Remote Devices

You can manage your tunnels remotely from the {{< link href="https://dashboard.pinggy.io/activedevices" >}}Pinggy dashboard{{</ link >}} using the remote devices feature. All you need to do is run the Pinggy CLI and connect it in remote-management mode. This allows you to create, edit, and stop tunnels directly from the dashboard without needing physical access to your device.

> This feature is available with Pinggy Pro and Enterprise plans.

## Connecting a remote device

For connecting a remote device, you need to intall {{< link href="https://pinggy.io/cli" >}}Pinggy CLI{{</ link >}}, and get an {{< link href="https://dashboard.pinggy.io/api-keys" >}}API Key{{</ link >}}.

**Step 1.** Install the  {{< link href="https://pinggy.io/cli" >}}Pinggy CLI{{</ link >}} by following the instructions {{< link href="https://pinggy.io/cli" >}}here{{</ link >}}.

**Step 2.** Create an API Key from the dashboard by logging in to {{< link href="https://dashboard.pinggy.io/api-keys" >}}API Key{{</ link >}}. You can name your API key appropriately to later identify the device you are connecting.


You will receive an API key (example: `xoBlIhaxriopBWSTZ7c62V`) which can use to connect your CLI.


**Step 3.** Run the Pinggy CLI in remote management mode.

```bash
./pinggy --remote-management <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

Example:

```bash
./pinggy --remote-management xoBlIhaxriopBWSTZ7c62V
```



## Manage tunnels for a remote device

To view your active remote devices, log in to {{< link href="https://dashboard.pinggy.io/activedevices" >}}https://dashboard.pinggy.io/activedevices{{</ link >}}

There you will find a list of your active devices. Click on the device you want to manage.

You can achive the following using remote device management:

- Keep your remote device connected and initiate new tunnels whenever you want without physically accessing the device
- Create new HTTP(S) / TCP / UDP / TLS tunnels
- Modify and change settings of existing tunnels
- Monitor the tunnels
